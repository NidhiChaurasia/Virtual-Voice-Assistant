# Virtual-Voice-Assistant
Built a tiny project using Python who can talk to you and give you some basic information . 

And before running the code please ensure to run the following commands in the terminal :-

pip install pyjokes,
pip install PyAudio,
pip install pyttsx3,
pip install SpeechRecognition,
pip install wikipedia,
pip install pywhatkit

Now you are good to go ! To test your Virtual-Assistant at your own pace and to change the voice of your Assistant you could make necessary changes like in the line 11 of code:-


#You could change the voice id from 1 to 2,3,4,etc and choose that fits you the best.



engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)

Also it's a beginner-friendly project with some awesome usage of Python libraries like datetime,SpeechRecognition,pyjokes ,etc. More to Explore !
